/*


A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the sequence {A,B,D} is a subsequence of {A,B,C,D,E,F}, obtained after removal of elements C, E and F.

Given two strings A and B of size n and m respectively, you have to print the Longest Common Subsequence(LCS) of strings A and B, where LCS is the longest sequence present in both A and B.

Note: It is gauranteed that there is only one unique longest common subsequence
Input Format

Two strings A and B.
Constraints

1 <= n,m <= 10^3
Output Format

Output the LCS of A and B.
Sample Input

abc
acd

Sample Output

ac
